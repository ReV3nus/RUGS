# RUGS: Relightable Unity Gaussian Splatting
This project is based on [GS-IR](https://github.com/lzhnb/GS-IR) and [UnityGaussianSplatting](https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting).

In this project, I expanded the original code and implemented the relightable scenes for 3D reconstructions.

TBD
